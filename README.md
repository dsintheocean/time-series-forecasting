## Taxi Order Forecasting

### Project Description:
An aggregator company has gathered historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during peak demand periods, it's essential to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour. The goal is to build a model for such forecasting.
The target metric is Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and the target value on the test dataset should not exceed 48.

### Data Description:
The data is stored in the 'taxi.csv' file. The number of orders is located in the 'num_orders' column.
